Bloon app, based on the Bloom app for the iphone and ipad by Brian Eno. Pick the length of the loop in ms, press buttons on 256, button presses will loop.

X = notes
Y = velocity

X scale can be changed from standard scales without affecting the loop.

App outputs midi.

If left alone, the app will become generative, each note can change +1, -1 stay the same on the X axis each time it plays.
